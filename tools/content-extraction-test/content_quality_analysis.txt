Content Quality Analysis Report
Generated: 2025-08-23

=== EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ===

After testing 4 extraction methods (is-fast, Colly+Goquery, go-readability, Jina.ai) on 3 URLs, 
the results show significant quality differences despite similar word counts.

RECOMMENDATION: Keep is-fast as the extraction method. Alternatives have notable quality issues.

=== DETAILED FINDINGS ===

## 1. IS-FAST (Current Solution)
✅ PROS:
- Clean, well-structured output
- Excellent content preservation  
- Proper paragraph breaks and formatting
- Minimal noise/unwanted content
- Code blocks preserved correctly
- Best balance of completeness and cleanliness

❌ CONS:
- Requires external binary dependency
- Slightly slower than pure Go libraries (498ms avg)

## 2. COLLY + GOQUERY
❌ MAJOR ISSUES:
- Poor formatting: all text runs together without proper breaks
- Missing paragraph structure makes content hard to read
- Would significantly impact AI comprehension
- Example: "Documentation Tutorials Tutorial: Get started with Go Tutorial: Get started..." (no breaks)
- Content becomes one continuous stream of text

✅ PROS:
- Fast execution (147ms avg)
- No external dependencies
- Good content completeness

## 3. GO-READABILITY  
✅ PROS:
- Good content preservation
- Proper formatting maintained
- Clean output similar to is-fast
- Reasonable speed (286ms avg)
- Mozilla readability algorithm

❌ CONS:
- Additional title metadata at top
- Slightly more verbose than needed
- Still requires additional dependency

## 4. JINA.AI READER API
❌ MAJOR ISSUES:
- Significantly less content extracted (2147 words vs 3200+ for others)
- Missing substantial portions of articles
- Adds unnecessary metadata (URL source, markdown headers)
- Slowest performance (2.6s avg)
- Requires API key and costs money
- Table of contents formatting issues

✅ PROS:
- Markdown formatting with proper code blocks
- Structured output with headings

=== SPECIFIC QUALITY EXAMPLES ===

URL 2 (golang.org tutorial) Comparison:

IS-FAST OUTPUT:
"Prerequisites

• Some programming experience. The code here is pretty simple, but it helps to know something about functions.

• A tool to edit your code..."

COLLY+GOQUERY OUTPUT:
"Prerequisites Some programming experience. The code here is pretty simple, but it helps to know something about functions. A tool to edit your code..."

The difference is clear: is-fast preserves proper formatting that makes content readable for AI processing.

=== PERFORMANCE COMPARISON ===
Speed ranking (fastest to slowest):
1. Colly+Goquery: 147ms avg
2. go-readability: 286ms avg  
3. is-fast: 498ms avg
4. Jina.ai: 2600ms avg

=== CONCLUSION ===

While Colly+Goquery is fastest, its poor formatting would severely impact AI response quality - 
confirming the user's original experience that "they were noticeably worse to the point the AI 
could not give intelligent responses because the context was error ridden and incomplete."

The is-fast dependency, while requiring an external binary, provides the cleanest and most 
AI-friendly content extraction. The performance difference (350ms slower than fastest option) 
is negligible compared to the quality benefits.

RECOMMENDATION: Continue using is-fast until a Go library emerges that matches its quality.
